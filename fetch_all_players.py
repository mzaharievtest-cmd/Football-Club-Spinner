"""
Fetch a small sample of active 2025/26 players from Premier League clubs.

This script:
- reads teams.json (to find Premier League clubs)
- for each club retrieves players whose P54 (member of sports team) statement
  has qualifiers indicating the membership overlaps the 2025/26 season
  (i.e. either no end date or end >= 2025-07-01, and either no start or start <= 2026-06-30)
- uses the player_images module to resolve image metadata and download images
- stops after `limit_total_players` (default 5) so you can validate quickly

Place this file next to player_images.py and teams.json and run:
  python fetch_all_players.py

Outputs:
- player_images/EPL/<downloaded files>
- player_images/attribution.csv
